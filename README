ABOUT --V8 2019
Program written by Borchr27 as a sub assembly tracker to allow an employee to type in a finished 
goods part number then return all the individual parts/part numbers within that assembly. 
Program uses tkinter to create a user interface. Also packaged the program into a nice little executable file.

CODE
The code uses Pandas to translate the excel file into a workable/searchable format.
The SEARCH function locates the initial part number in the excel file.
It then pulls all the sub assembly or final part numbers into two lists.
One list (fnpl, which stands for final part number list) is used to store base level part numbers that have no sub assemblies.
The next list (sub_asms) is carried thru the functions and holds part numbers that still have sub assemblies.
